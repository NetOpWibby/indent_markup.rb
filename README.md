I love creating sites in Jekyll, and I also love seeing my HTML render beautifully when I `View Source`. This isn't a practical plugin by any means, but dammit, I need it in my life. This is a fork of Daniel Love's plugin of the same name, but optimized for how I feel indentation should look.



### Installation

Create a `_plugins` folder at the base of your Jekyll project and drop in `indent_markup.rb`. :boom:



### Usage

Put `{{ content | indent_space: 2}}` in your template files. For more options, check out [Daniel Love](http://daniellove.net/posts/jekyll/2014/05/23/jekyll-indent-markup)'s blog post.
